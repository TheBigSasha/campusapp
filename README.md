# Meet Your Classmates
## What’s Different
Unlike large social networks, this experience is restricted to specifically university students, verifying them with school issued email. It suggests people based on unique criteria like course schedule, place of origin, and major/concentration. These data points are specific to a campus restricted social platform and help bridge the gap between distant students.

## Core Ideas

### Security
A restriction to university students keeps content out of the public internet, on a secure and gated platform. Campus based activities and class related information can freely be shared knowing that it is among one’s fellow students.

### Accountability
Verification with school IDs provides another level of online safety and provides a robust system for holding platform users accountable, enabling an environment more free from abuse than is possible on other platforms.

### Approachability
Easy and intuitive matching based on common metrics, interests, and academic information makes the platform easy and approachable. As a data aggregation system, this application makes it easy to find people to connect with, and provides an easy way to connect to these people on established social platforms.
